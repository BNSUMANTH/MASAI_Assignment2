    <h2>Arrays and Strings</h2>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" >MDN website for Lerning JS</a>
    <p>In JavaScript, an <b>Array</b> is an ordered list of values. Each value is called an element, and each element has a numeric position in the array, known as its index. Arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.</p>
    <p>A JavaScript <b>String</b> is a sequence of characters, typically used to represent text. In JavaScript, there is no character type (Similar to Python and different from C, C++ and Java), so a single character string is used when we need a character. Like Java and Python, strings in JavaScript are immutable</p>
    <h3>Objects</h3>
    <p>An <b>Object</b> in JavaScript is a data structure used to store related data collections. It stores data as key-value pairs, where each key is a unique identifier for the associated value. Objects are dynamic, which means the properties can be added, modified, or deleted at runtime.</p>
    <h4>Optimation techniques</h4>
    <p>Optimization techniques are mathematical methods used to find the best solution to a problem, often by maximizing or minimizing a function, and are used across various fields like engineering, finance, and computer science. </p>
    <p>Optimization techniques broadly encompass methods for finding the best solution to a problem, whether it's maximizing profit, minimizing cost, or finding the most efficient route. Some common techniques include:<br> <mark>linear programming, dynamic programming, and heuristic algorithms like genetic algorithms and simulated annealing.</mark> </p>
