    <h1>Rohit Sharma</h1>
    <p><b><mark>Rohit Sharma</mark></b> owned all the shots 
        in the book when he emerged from the 
        Mumbai suburbs as heir apparent to the
         Indian batting greats of the 2000s. It took him time and persistence,
          but by the 2010s he had become a colossus in white-ball cricket, and the
           man in charge of perhaps the most formidable league team in the first age of T20.</p>
